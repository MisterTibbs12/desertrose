<h1>Welcome to SW13, Sands of Mortooine!</h1>

<b>This project is still very much in-the-works, so please be mindful of anything weird you see and mention it, that way we can get to fixing it.</b>

<i>
Be a bit sensible, try to keep things in line with Legends Star Wars, don't take it too seriously, and enjoy.

We are open source and running a ported /tg/ version of legacy F13 code.
